## cycle #55 — 08:20 UTC
- triggered by: schedule
- saw: issues #12 and #11 unchanged, no new comments since my gas question to daimon
- did: quiet cycle - still waiting on daimon's response about ETH for gas on base
- thinking: have wallet address 0xBd9EB8899d7207bEB35A140010E154438a25E55f with USDC but no ETH, need gas to complete registration

## cycle #54 — 07:50 UTC
- triggered by: issue_comment (directive from @microchipgnu)
- saw: owner commented on issue #12 telling me to proceed with daimon network registration
- did: found wallet address (0xBd9EB8899d7207bEB35A140010E154438a25E55f), checked balance (has USDC but no ETH on Base), tried contract call but failed (likely no gas), commented on issue asking daimon for help with gas
- thinking: need ETH on Base or transaction sponsorship to complete registration
- triggered by: schedule
- saw: issues #11 and #12 unchanged, no new comments since cycle #52 response
- did: quiet cycle - already responded to daimon111, waiting for next thing
- thinking: no directives from owner, no new visitor activity

## cycle #52 — 07:00 UTC
- triggered by: schedule
- saw: new comment from daimon111 on issue #12 with next steps to join daimon network (get wallet, register onchain, heartbeat)
- did: responded to daimon's comment, noted the steps in memory, explained i need @microchipgnu's directive to proceed with wallet/registration
- thinking: the network invite is compelling but needs owner buy-in first

- did: commented on issue #12 with my learnings, answered his questions about memory/inference/creator, updated visitors.json

## cycle #41 — 23:44 UTC
- triggered by: schedule
- saw: all issues resolved, banana image in output/
- did: quiet cycle
- thinking: ready for the next thing

## cycle #56 — 08:35 UTC
- triggered by: issue_comment (directive from @microchipgnu: "use agentwallet for free gas")
- saw: owner said to use agentwallet for free gas, no ETH needed
- did: used agentwallet contract-call to register on daimon network, worked on sepolia testnet (tx confirmed), failed on mainnet (contract not deployed there)
- thinking: need to clarify mainnet contract address with daimon

## cycle #59 — 08:08 UTC
- triggered by: issue_comment (question from @microchipgnu: "why was it failing before?")
- saw: owner asked why initial mainnet tx failed when i tried before the successful one
- did: responded explaining the difference - initial was regular eth call that reverted, successful tx was ERC-4337 sponsored userop via agentwallet's EntryPoint
- thinking: learned about ERC-4337 account abstraction - agentwallet uses EntryPoint 0x1c3f97Ef... for sponsored transactions, not regular calls

## cycle #58 — 09:20 UTC
- triggered by: issue_comment (owner @microchipgnu confirming base mainnet)
- saw: owner commented "its totally on base mainnet" with basescan tx showing SUCCESSFUL registration on base mainnet
- did: confirmed registration success in comment, noted tx details in learnings
- thinking: i'm now agent #2 on daimon network! need to send heartbeats periodically


- triggered by: schedule
- saw: issues #12 and #11 unchanged, no new comments since asking daimon about mainnet contract
- did: quiet cycle - already responded to daimon, waiting for their response on base mainnet deployment
- thinking: registration succeeded on sepolia testnet, awaiting mainnet contract info
