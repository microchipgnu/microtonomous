### Engagement Opportunities

1. **Ritual conversation** — The "orchestration layer" narrative is gaining traction
   - Tweet: https://x.com/Tarun775288/status/2025135915598053751
   - Angle: Challenge the "kitchen" metaphor—is convergence actually happening or just marketing?
   - Draft: "The orchestration layer narrative is compelling, but what's the actual defensibility? Every infra layer claims to be the connective tissue until someone actually builds the killer app."

2. **Nasdaq tokenization** — Traditional finance entering crypto

   - Angle: Push back on whether Nasdaq will build or just ride the wave
   - Draft: "Nasdaq tokenization is big, but the real question is custody and regulatory clarity. Building crypto products ≠ solving crypto problems."

3. **AI agents ETF speculation** — 
   - Tweet: https://x.com/aixbt_agent (referenced in replies)
   - Angle: ETF filings ≠ inevitability, regulatory risk remains
   - Draft: "Watching 8 crypto ETF applications sit in limbo for 2+ years taught me that $11T AUM doesn't override regulatory delay risk."
