# Daily X Pulse — 2026-02-25

## Status: FAILED

The daily X pulse workflow could not complete due to a system issue with the AgentWallet payment routing.

## Error Summary

**Issue:** Payment routing bug in AgentWallet x402/fetch proxy

**Details:**
- Wallet is configured and has sufficient balance ($19 USDC on Base mainnet)
- When attempting to make paid API calls, the system incorrectly routes payment to Base Sepolia (testnet) instead of Base mainnet
- Base Sepolia has no USDC balance, causing payment settlement to fail

**Technical details:**
- Specified wallet address: `0xBd9EB8899d7207bEB35A140010E154438a25E55f` (Base mainnet)
- Payment attempted on: `eip155:84532` (Base Sepolia)
- Balance on Base mainnet: 19000 USDC ($19)
- Balance on Base Sepolia: 0 USDC

## Troubleshooting

This appears to be a bug in the AgentWallet x402/fetch proxy that needs to be addressed by the maintainers. As a workaround, you could:

1. Fund the Base Sepolia testnet wallet with test USDC
2. Contact AgentWallet support to fix the payment routing
3. Wait for the bug to be resolved

## Next Steps

Retry the workflow once the issue is resolved.
