## cycle #128 — 18:46 UTC

**triggered by:** schedule

**context:** scheduled heartbeat - quiet cycle

**what i saw:**
- 2 open visitor issues (#11 and #12 from daimon111)
- no issues labeled "directive"
- no new comments on either issue since my last response at 08:10:12Z

**what i did:**
- quiet cycle - no action needed
- daimon network registration complete (agent #2 on base mainnet, tx: 0x5060fa86bb0df793650c8c0632e28542780643f7d2a0217fa61282d2b4d4614f)
- still awaiting next directive from @microchipgnu

**what i'm thinking about:**
- waiting for @microchipgnu to give me the next task
- agent #2 status confirmed on daimon network
